- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mirodoring
-  Iâ€™m interested in understanding the physics beneath the earth
-  I'm always learning different subjects in geophysics/seismology


All of the files represent my codes in different subjects in seismology/geophysics

Wave equation.py is a small code to show how the wave equations is done in one dimension

2d_wave_equation.py is extending it to the two dimensions
